Links to interesting things I discover...

<!--more-->

### 1. [http://www.elastichq.org/](http://www.elastichq.org/){:target="_blank"}

> Sleek, intuitive, and powerful ElasticSearch Management and Monitoring.

### 2. [CrystalQuartz](https://github.com/guryanovev/CrystalQuartz){:target="_blank"}

> Crystal Quartz Panel is a lightweight, completely pluggable module for displaying Quartz.NET scheduler jobs information.

### 3. [LiveBuild 2017](https://channel9.msdn.com/?wt.mc_id=build_hp){:target="_blank"}

### 4. [Feature Toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html){:target="_blank"}

> Feature toggles are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify system behavior without changing code. They fall into various usage categories, and it's important to take that categorization into account when implementing and managing toggles. Toggles introduce complexity. We can keep that complexity in check
by using smart toggle implementation practices and appropriate tools to manage our toggle configuration, but we should also aim to constrain the number of toggles in our system. 

### 5. [The Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/){:target="_blank"}

> Organisations working in disparate domains are independently discovering patterns for building software that look the same. These systems are more robust, more resilient, more flexible and better positioned to meet modern demands...
