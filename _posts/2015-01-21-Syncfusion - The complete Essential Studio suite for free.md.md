I discovered that syncfusion offers a community edition of [their essential studio for free](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense).

I first met this company thanks to their [free to download consice e-books](https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks) which I highly recommend. It was kind of surprise to find that they created a community licence with the whole enterprise package. If you are not already a registered user, register yourself and claim your key. You'll download essential studio and access to very nice controls for several different platforms (from wpf to javascript, universal app included).

 At first look, there are a lot of examples and a _seems-to-be-complete_ documentation. I'll definitely give it a try and share a sample application here.
