[The company I am working for -**Novencia TS**-](http://www.novencia.com/news/mstechdays2015-we-are-partner) [will make a presentation on 10/02/2015](https://techdays.microsoft.fr/evenement/ambient-intelligence.aspx). The title of the session is **Ambient Intelligence & Big Data**.

It will be a nice discussion about

*   What is ambient intelligence
*   What are the challanges
*   What is the actual state of the art ? (by presenting techniques that are used)

This will also be an excellent opportunity to see what is _-can be-_ done in the .NET world using Wep API, Mongo DB, Cassandra & Hadoop, Azur with connected objects. **SUBSCRIBE, RIGHT NOW ! :)**
