If you want to smile _-it is really fun-_ and listen to a good critic of programming languages : 

[[Skills Matter] Mark Rendle - The worst programming language ever](https://www.skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6088-the-worst-programming-language-ever){:target="_blank"} 

Takes approximately 1h to watch. **Highly recommended!**
