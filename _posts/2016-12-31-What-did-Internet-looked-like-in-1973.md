I was reading my tweets this morning, I came across this a tweet which illustrates whole 
internet (named [ArpaNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET){:target="_blank"} back than) 
on A4 size paper :)

David Newbury sends the tweet below and others enriched the tweet with the schemas they have.

I placed the images in chronological order. I think it is quite impressive to view the evolution of the network. Here is the result :
