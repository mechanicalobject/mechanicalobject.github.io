**THIS POST WAS WRITTEN WHEN I WAS USING WORDPRESS TO HOST MY BLOG**

As I shared with you in [About page](http://blog.mechanicalobject.com/about/){:target="_blank"},
I am using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"} for 
this blog. 

<!--more-->

It allows me to format my article in a _HTML-free_ way and it produces a nice output. The 
problem is that with the [Jetpack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/){:target="_blank"} 
I am using you don't see the output right-away. When I write an article I like to see 
the output and fix it if necessary. 

I tried a wordpress plugin named [WP-Markdown](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown/){:target="_blank"} 
which gives the possibility to visualize what you write under the text editor of wordpress 
but it wasn't as fluent as I would like it to be. After some quick search I found 
[StackEdit](https://stackedit.io){:target="_blank"}. It really renders the output nicely 
while I write my article and it lets me to work offline. 

In addition to that sometimes you cannot log in to your admin console. When this is the 
case I write my article and send it to myself by mail in markdown format, review it later 
and post the article. I strongly recommend to take a look and try!
