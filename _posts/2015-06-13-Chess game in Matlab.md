In april 2015, I followed an excellent [Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml){:target="_blank"}
Lectures were given by [Andrew Ng](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/){:target="_blank"} and throughout this course the language/development 
platform used was [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/){:target="_blank"} *-an open source alternative to Matlab-*.

Needless to say that I enjoyed lectures and programming exercices *-you can go and see machine learning page for more resources 
if you are interested in-*, this experience made me curious about Matlab because its *-open source equivalent, Octave-* 
was very powerful on complex algebra operations,visualization of data points and mathematical operations *-it uses GNUPLOT-*.

A few weeks later, I noticed an online course on Matlab : 
[Introduction to Programming with MATLAB](https://www.coursera.org/course/matlab){:target="_blank"} offered by Vanderbilt University on Coursera.

I enrolled to the course and I finished a few weeks earlier than the hard deadline. This was the third course I finished on Coursera 
but it is the first course during which I visited the forums, ask questions when I was stuck, read others questions and algorithms proposed etc.

Well the title of the article is **Chess Game in Matlab** and I explained all this unrelated staff to you and you might now wonder 
what is the link between the article title and all the gibberish I made you read.

I found a complete working chess program on [Matlab forums](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47272-chess-master){:target="_blank"}
including source code, instructions on how to execute etc. The only thing to do is to dive into the source code and discover how it is 
concieved which I am doing since this morning.

I wrote all these just to share that, life is quite beautiful in the sense of *one thing leads to another thing*. I was interested in how machine learning algorithms work, that led me to Coursera course which led me to working on Octave which made me curious about Matlab which motivated me to take a Coursera course *-again-* on Matlab which led me to find this very interesting source code and analyze it.
