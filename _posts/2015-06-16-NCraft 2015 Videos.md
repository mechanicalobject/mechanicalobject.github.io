I had the chance to attend to NCraft 2015 that took place in Paris. All sessions were recorded and 
[some of them have been published on the web site](http://videos.ncrafts.io/page/2){:target="_blank"}
Among the available videos, my favorites are:

* **Hadi Hariri - The Silver Bullet Syndrome**
* **Phil Trelford - WRITE YOUR OWN COMPILER IN 24 HOURS** 
* **Evelina Gabasova - MACHINE LEARNING THE F# WAY**
