This week, I found about two projects realized by Microsoft and I would like to share them:

*   [Hololens](http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us) : I highly recommend to wath the video. Not only it is impressive but it gives you ideas. If you are a developer, you'll realize huge work behind this project. I cannot imagine how they achieved that :) It is my humble opinion that the following sentence that you'll find in the video resumes very well this exceptional initiative :

> ... because when you change the way you see the world you can change the world you see.

*   [World Wide Telescope](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/) : Are you living and working in a city? You are up early in the morning to go to work and when you come home, is it already night? When was the last time you looked up at the sky and saw stars ? Just click on the link and enjoy them.
