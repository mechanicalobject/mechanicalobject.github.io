I am a **bug farmer**. I like algorithms, clean code, design patterns and I have an interest in data science, particularly in machine learning. 

I love learning new things and MOOCs are an excellent opportunity. Here are the moocs I completed *-I hope that list will get longer with time-*.

## **Why this blog ?**

Multiple reasons :

1.  I have an awful memory, I write some piece of code or find a solution to a problem and then I forget :). This blog lets me write 
about things I experiment and then recall later easily.
2.  Sharing knowledge. Let me simply put that way, **I learnt (and still learning) a lot of things on the internet thanks to beautiful people** who 
share their knowledge and experience. I'll be glad if I can return the favor.

## **Blogging software**

Before, I was using wordpress hosted on a windows server 2012. I decided in June 2015 to migrate my existing blog to GitHub pages.
The migration of all my posts is not finished completely at the moment I am writing this phrase :). I'll migrate posts piece by piece
depending on my availability.

*   Jekyll-Bootstrap and [JekyllMetro](https://github.com/olakara/JekyllMetro){:target="_blank"} theme
*   Hosted on GitHub
